# This workflow builds an OpenFAST docker image for the linux/amd64 and linux/aarch64 architectures on merge into
# `main` from a release candidate branch. The image is tagged both with "latest" and the version extracted from the
# release candidate branch's name (e.g. "rc-3.5.3") before being pushed to the `nrel/openfast` repository. The build
# cache is stored in GitHub actions.
